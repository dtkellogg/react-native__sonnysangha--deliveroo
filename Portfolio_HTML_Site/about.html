                    <p>My name is Toshi. I'm currently 28 years old, and am working towards become a software engineer.
                        I have been working as a private tutor since graduating college in 2015. I've not only really
                        enjoyed teaching and mentoring kids, but I've also been able to enjoy my life and practice my
                        true love of traveling. I was once a division I runner and still and enjoy running most days.
                        I also love rockclimbing and other outdoor activities.
                    </p>

                    <p>To jumpstart my career as a software engineer, I applied and got into App Academy. Unfortunately,
                        due to the corona virus outbreak, I decided pull out of the bootcamp as I am able to learn
                        everything online, but wanted to go to the bootcamp to make connections in the field. I will 
                        probably still go to a bootcamp; however, my experience with my coordinator at App Academy has left
                        me with a strange feeling about their camp. Therefore, I will most likely attend Hack Reactor.
